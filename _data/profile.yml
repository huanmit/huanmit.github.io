  <p>
    I recently graduated with a Master's degree in Software Engineering from SCS of Carnegie Mellon University and joined AWS as a Software Development Engineer. Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Tongji University. During my Bachelor degree, I interned at Shanghai AI Lab and ByteDance AI Lab.
  </p>
  <p>
    My background in software engineering has provided me with strong engineering skills. Based on this foundation, my primary experiences and interests include but are not limited to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>NLP: LLM alignment, Low-resource NLP, Distillation</li>
    <li>MLOps: ML Pipelines, Anomaly Detection</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You could also refer to the <a href="https://huanmit.github.io/projects" target="_blank">projects</a> page for details. Additionally, I am currently keen to explore the fields of LLMs and MLSys.
  </p>

    <em>I am attending EMNLP in Suzhou, China and NeurIPS in San Diego in Nov and Dec 2025. Feel free to connect with me if you are also attending these conferences! I am open to discussing a wide range of interesting topics, including but not limited to potential collaboration opportunities. Please feel free to reach out if you'd like to have a chat!</em>
